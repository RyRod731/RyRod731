Lighting and sound was tricky to do with Unity still learning about how to use this develping tool but I will say sound is something I at least want to get better with.
Though lighting I did have some issues at first with positioning and how to properly position the light but I soon found a decent place to put it.
Matching sound was difficult at first but I was able to somehow make it work especially with the kart.
