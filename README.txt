I chose to create the Karting microgame over the FPS one is because I am not that into FPS games at all and karting games are kinda up my alley.
The challenges that I faced in this microgame is placing obstacles and just the general importing of 3D objects.
Though ther asset I found was one I made and it was just a simple block obstacle that I created in Maya.
